    "\n",
    "A core responsibility of The National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) is to collect, analyze, and disseminate international travel and tourism statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "NTTO's Board of Managers are charged with managing, improving, and expanding the system to fully account and report the impact of travel and tourism in the United States. The analysis results help to forcecast and operation, support make decision creates a positive climate for growth in travel and tourism by reducing institutional barriers to tourism, administers joint marketing efforts, provides official travel and tourism statistics, and coordinates efforts across federal agencies.\n",

    "In this project, some source datas will be use to do data modeling:\n",
    "* **I94 Immigration**: The source data for I94 immigration data is available in local disk in the format of sas7bdat. This data comes from US National Tourism and Trade Office. The data dictionary is also included in this project for reference. The actual source of the data is from https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html. This data is already uploaded to the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **World Temperature Data**: This dataset came from Kaggle. This data is already uploaded to the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Airport Code**: This is a simple table with airport codes. The source of this data is from https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes#data. It is highly recommended to use it for educational purpose only but not for commercial or any other purpose. This data is already uploaded to the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **U.S. City Demographic Data**: This data comes from OpenSoft link https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/\n",

    "* Other validation text files such as *I94Addr.txt*, *I94CIT_I94RES.txt*, *I94Mode.txt*, *I94Port.txt** and **I94Visa.txt* extracted from the *I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS*.\n",
